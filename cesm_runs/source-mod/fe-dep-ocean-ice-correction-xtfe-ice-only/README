This directory includes code modifications necessary to tune parameters of
dust-dependent iron flux to account for non-linearities in the parameterization
when applied to monthly-mean, ensemble mean dust fields.

This code is consistent with the XTFe implementation.

In this version, XTFe deposition over the ocean is zeroed out: deposition only
occurs on sea-ice.
